\cf2 	I am trying to create a breakout game that can release our pressure on the final. So I called my game \'92Kill the Final\'92. I made the following extensions in the game:\
	1. Change the brick to GImage with final picture on it(I created that picture).\
	2. Change the ball with the ball image provided in the Images folder by CS 1110\'92s instructor.\
	3. Improve user control over bounces. If the ball hits the left (or right) 1/4 of the paddle, the ball goes back the way it came.\
	4. Add an applause sound effect \'91win.wav\'92  when the user cleans a whole row. The License of the sound effect: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.soundjay.com/tos.html"}}{\fldrslt http://www.soundjay.com/tos.html}}\
	5. Add the bounce sound effect of the ball. The sound effect \'91bounce.wav\'92 is provided in the Sounds f\cf0 \cb1 \outl0\strokewidth0 older by CS 1110\'92s instructor.\
	6. Add the collide sound effect if the ball hit the bricks. The sound effect \'91plate2.wav\'92 is provided in the Sounds folder by CS 1110\'92s instructor.\
	7. Score user\'92s performance. Every time he removes one brick, he will get 2 points.\
	8. Add the winning screen and failure screen for reminding them go back to study the final in reality LOL.\
